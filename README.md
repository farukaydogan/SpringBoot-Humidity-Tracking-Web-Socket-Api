# SpringBoot-Humidity-Tracking-Web-Socket-Api
## This innovative project combines cutting-edge technologies, including Spring Boot, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, JavaScript, MQTT, WebSocket, Arduino, SIM Shield, ESP32, and LoRa module. It seamlessly integrates these components to create a powerful system. At its core, this system remotely manages irrigation, continuously monitors soil moisture levels, and promptly notifies users of any issues. It intelligently determines the most suitable irrigation method and plant types for optimal nourishment. Real-time data from the field or garden, equipped with solar panels, is transmitted to a RESTful API using a SIM card. You can effortlessly access and visualize this live data on the frontend, hosted on an Amazon EC2 server. Furthermore, device information can be effortlessly updated using MQTT, the latest communication technology. To ensure secure access, the system employs JSON Web Tokens, allowing multiple users to interact with it effortlessly.
